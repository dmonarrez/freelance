## Research, Inspiration and Brainstorming

From my research coupled with the clients requests, I think that a clean gray-scale site with light pops of green (because there are a lot of plants in the pictures provided and would also fall into the nw theme as a local space) will give the luxurious and modern feel they are looking for in the site. From my research, it is clear that a one page design might be the way to go. All of the relevant information that someone who is interested in a space like this should be on the first page they hit and then potentially more detailed pages for individual pieces of information like room bookings.
